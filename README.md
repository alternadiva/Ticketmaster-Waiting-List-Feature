# Ticketmaster Waiting List Feature

## User Stories

#### As a fan, I’d like to… 
- have the ability to join the waiting list from the event details page so I can be notified if tickets become available
- be reminded to sign in, when I’m not, so I am able to add myself to the waiting list
- see the email address field pre-filled after login so I don’t have to type my email address again
- have the option to submit either my phone number, my email address or both so I can set my notification preferences
- get visual feedback, when I fill out the field or submit the form incorrectly so I know what to correct
- get visual confirmation about my subscription so that I will immediately know if it was successful or not

#### As a visually impaired fan, I want to…
- use keyboard controls so I can navigate the website and activate elements on the page
- hear my screen reader describe the content on the website so I can get information about the type of elements on the page

As an aesthetically conscious fan, I’d like to see the same design elements the website has so I can use an aesthetically pleasing feature

As a mobile user, I'd like to see only the form section on my screen so I can avoid horizontal scrolling
