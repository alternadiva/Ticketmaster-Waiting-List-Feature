## Ticketmaster - Waiting List Feature üéü üóí

### Description

Solution for the take-home challenge presented by Ticketmaster. This is my attempt at completing one of the user stories of the Waiting List feaure.‚è≥

üîó **Deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://alternadiva.github.io/Ticketmaster-Waiting-List-Feature/)**

--- 

### Vision 

Create a website feature, that will allow the fans to join the waitlist and be notified via email and/or text message if more tickets become available for sale.

### Chosen User Story: 

**As a fan, I‚Äôd like to get visual confirmation about my subscription so that I will immediately know if it was successful or not #6**

#### Subtasks:

- [x] Stub waiting list API to imitate fetch response #15
- [x] Compare waiting list data and form data #14
- [x] Confirm subscription #16
- [x] Confirm prior subscription #17

#### Guideline to test the solution on the UI:
‚úÖ To get a visual confirmation about a successful sign up, insert the following values to the input fields
  - Mobile number: +441122334455
  - Email address: test@email.com
  
‚ö†Ô∏è To get a warning about an already existing sign up, insert the following values to the input fields
  - Mobile number: +440123456789
  - Email address: example@example.com

### User Stories

As a fan, I‚Äôd like to‚Ä¶ 
- have the ability to join the waiting list from the event details page so I can be notified if tickets become available
- be reminded to sign in, when I‚Äôm not, so I am able to add myself to the waiting list
- see the email address field pre-filled after login so I don‚Äôt have to type my email address again
- have the option to submit either my phone number, my email address or both so I can set my notification preferences
- get visual feedback, when I fill out the field or submit the form incorrectly so I know what to correct
- get visual confirmation about my subscription so that I will immediately know if it was successful or not

As a visually impaired fan, I want to‚Ä¶
- use keyboard controls so I can navigate the website and activate elements on the page
- hear my screen reader describe the content on the website so I can get information about the type of elements on the page

As an aesthetically conscious fan, I‚Äôd like to see the same design elements the website has so I can use an aesthetically pleasing feature

As a mobile user, I'd like to see only the form section on my screen so I can avoid horizontal scrolling
